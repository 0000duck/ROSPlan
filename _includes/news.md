## New Features in the Latest Version

- New **tutorials** and **documentation** has been written to walk a user through each component of ROSPlan.  
- The Knowledge Base now keeps track of **timed-initial literals and functions**; **metrics**; and **numeric expressions**.
- An **initial state** can be loaded into the Knowledge Base from a PDDL problem file.  
- Multiple Knowledge Bases can now be run in parallel for systems which use multiple domains, or multiple states.
- New implementations of the Planner Interface: FF, Metric-FF, Contingent-FF, LPG, Fast Downward, TFD, SMTPlan, and UPMurphi.
- The ESTEREL plan formalism now fully supports **temporal plans with concurrent actions and timed-initial literals**.
- The new **simulated action node** can be used to test a planning and execution system with actions competing with a user defined probability.
