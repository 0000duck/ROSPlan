## New Features in the Latest Version (June 2018)

- New **tutorials** and **documentation** to walk through each component of ROSPlan.  
- The Knowledge Base now handles **metrics**, **timed-initial-literals**, and **numeric expressions**.
- **Initial states** can be loaded into the Knowledge Base directly from a PDDL problem file.
- Plan execution now fully supports **temporal plans with concurrent actions and timed-initial-literals**, through the ESTEREL plan dispatching.
- Multiple Knowledge Bases can now be run in parallel for systems which use multiple domains, or multiple states.
- Interfaces available for many planners (POPF, OPTIC, FF, Metric-FF, Contingent-FF, LPG, Fast Downward, TFD, SMTPlan, and UPMurphi).
- The new **simulated action node** can be used for testing, completing actions with a user-defined probability.
- Additional features coming soon! Stay tuned and join the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rosplan).
